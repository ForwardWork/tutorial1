This is the first bit of learning into GIT/ GITHUB/ GITLAB using 
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/

there are instructions but lots of links to git that show why something is being done and how to do it.

Whilst this is via free code camp I did already have the following set up

Github account, Git bash installed on my machine, gotdesktop and have some responsotries added to my account that I am working on (TDD) help

Adding some omore to this file as need to repeat the git commit and push to origin as got wrong thr first time.

right stae going back and forth but cannot see any "origin" branch or repository so am going to change the files, make a new one and then see if I cannot get these pushed to the repository
